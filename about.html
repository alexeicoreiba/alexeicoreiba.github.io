                I was accepted into the University of Toronto for Computer Science in 2016.
                It was during this time that I was also introduced to the world of photography, which quickly inspired
                me to hike and travel to capture images and share them with family and friends.
                <br><br>
                I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering in
                2020. I then moved to Vancouver to start my first full
                time job as a Software Development Engineer I at Amazon Web Services, where I work to this day.

                Vancouver has ignited my passion for the outdoors and photography. The surrounding nature and mountains
                have been a pleasure to explore and photograph, and I am filled with joy every time I step foot outside
                my door.
                I am always looking for people to hike with and explore, so feel free to contact me if interested!
                <br><br>
                When not working or hiking, I love training martial arts. I've spent my teens doing TaeKwonDo, achieving
                1st Dan in 2015. I am now actively training in Muay Thai and 10th Planet Jiu
                Jitsu. Martial arts will always be part of my life and something I take pride in.
