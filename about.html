                I was accepted into the University of Toronto for Computer Science in 2016.
                It was during this time that I was also introduced to the world of photography, which quickly inspired
                me to hike and travel to capture images and share them with family and friends.
                <br><br>
                I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering in
                2020. I then moved to Vancouver to start my first full
                time job as a Software Development Engineer I at Amazon Web Services. I have since moved on and am currently working
                as a Software Engineer II at PayPal.

                Vancouver has ignited my passion for the outdoors and photography. The surrounding nature and mountains
                have been a pleasure to explore and photograph, and I am filled with joy every time I step foot outside
                my door.
                I am always looking for people to hike with and explore, so feel free to contact me if interested!
                <br><br>
                When not working or hiking, I love training martial arts. I've achieved my 1st Dan in TaeKwonDo and am now 
                actively training in Muay Thai and 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu. Martial arts will always be part of my life and something I take pride in.
